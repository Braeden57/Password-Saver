            in your account.

         -V(2.5) Change Save Password Implement.
            You can now change the password you save in your
            account.

         -V(2.4) No same user names. If a username is taken
            You'll need to choose a name not used by someone else.

         -V[Rewrite](2.2) Security Update! All previous versions
            focused on the data and not on the actual
            security. One way hashing has been implemented
            as the first layer of security. Still only one
            password can be stored in your account.
